In the given example, a WriteStream object is created to write data to a file called “destination.txt”. The purpose is to write a sequence of numbers from 0 to 10,000,000 in that file. To accomplish this, a function named writeToFile is defined, which handles the writing process.

Inside the writeToFile function, two methods provided by the WriteStream object are utilized. The write method is used to write each number to the stream, ensuring that the data is stored in the file. This method also returns a boolean value that indicates whether the buffer used for writing is full or not.

When all the numbers have been written, the end method is called. This signifies that it is the final write operation, allowing the WriteStream to complete any remaining writes and finalize the writing process. Upon finishing, the WriteStream emits a special event called finish, which can be utilized to perform any necessary tasks, such as gracefully closing the WriteStream.
